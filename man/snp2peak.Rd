\arguments{
\item{snp_info}{Data frame containing SNP information (required columns: CHR, POS, LP, SNP)}

\item{peak2gene_strength}{List containing GRN output, with a 'Regions' column for peaks}

\item{buffer}{Numeric value specifying the flanking sizes (default = 0)
- extend peak range (upstream and downstream + 50bp)
- buffer = 50bp, represent add 50 bp to both upstream and downstream of peak}
}
\value{
Data frame mapping SNPs to genomic peaks with associated log-transformed p-values
}
